What will you be building? Why is that a valuable open source contribution to Handshake?
ShakeCities is a geocities clone with an emphasis on Handshake domains.  
Create a free site on yourname.shakecities/. You control that site and can add whatever you want to it.  
Every domain comes enabled with HTTPS via DANE. We have support HIP02 aliases, so you can send HNS to yourname.shakecities/  

This will be a valuable resource to the Handshake community as it will allow new users to deploy a website in minutes.  
In addition it will include information on how to create a site to the users own domains to encourage them to move towards decentralisation.



What are completion criteria?
Fully working project site with user pages actively served over HTTPS.
